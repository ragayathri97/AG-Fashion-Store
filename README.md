## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ragayathri97/deployJsonUsingGlitch.git

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## How It Works

1. **Product Display**: 
    - The products are fetched from a remote API, and the product details (like price, rating, stock) are displayed in the cart.
2. **Cart Management**: 
    - The cart is stored in the browserâ€™s `localStorage`, allowing the cart's state to persist even when the page is reloaded.
    - Users can increase or decrease product quantities in the cart, with stock limitations.
3. **Coupon Code**: 
    - Users can apply coupon codes for discounts (e.g., `NEWYEAR` for $50 off or `CODE2121` for $20 off). Invalid codes show an error message.
4. **Dynamic Updates**: 
    - Any changes in the cart are reflected in real-time, including price updates when quantities change.
